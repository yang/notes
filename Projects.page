H-Store Recovery and Elasticity
-------------------------------

H-Store

- distributed transaction manager is exciting and central to H-Store
- H-Store as a whole easy to believe in and is not a marginal project
- recovery/elasticity could make for interesting demos

Recovery

- recovery: based on [HARBOR]
  - HARBOR's approach:
    - asynchronous disk checkpointing
    - query snapshots for updates since failure
    - query current data for final updates since start of recovery
    - generally: snapshot isolation/time travel minimizes impact on
      availability
  - obvious strategies
    - network-only: recover entirely from replicas (network BW > disk BW, but
      interference with ongoing transaction processing)
    - hybrid network and disk: similar to HARBOR, but taking snapshots is
      hard/expensive
    - disk-only: same as ARIES
- thought process
  - assumptions
    - high update rate
    - updates distributed uniformly at random
    - so all pages are quickly touched
    - assuming that all updates are applied in same order on each replica; is
      this valid?
  - stupid algo
    - regularly flush page snapshots to disk (asyncly)
      - use COW to take snapshots/avoid blocking
      - COW lasts only for duration of flush; no copy might be nec
      - if update during flush is likely, then just make eager copy
    - recover by seeing which pages are touched and grab latest from replicas
    - but all pages are out of date (useless)
    - so you'd need to transfer entire state from other machines, a long op
      - to avoid interrupting other replicas, transfer snapshots
      - simultaneously stream in new updates and apply them after getting state
  - consider logging
    - concerned only with redo logging (to prevent lost updates)
    - volatile undo logging: we need this anyway to be able to undo xacts
      - so one log for both purposes
      - redo log should generally dictate length
      - xacts are short, so undos don't stick around
    - non-vol undo logging: for buffer frame steals that swap dirty pages to
      disk
    - but we have no disk, and no such thing as dirty pages on replicas
  - algo v1: assuming identical update ordering (see above assumption)
    - LSN: log seq num
    - an update is a lower-level concept than query updates, transactions,
      commits
    - we log all updates; hence we log undo operations as well
    - each page has pageLSN of latest touching update
    - minLSN is the min pageLSN
    - in normal operation, do regular flushing as above
    - on recovery, ask others for log of all updates following minLSN
      - let these be the _redo updates_
    - simultaneously stream in new updates that have been submitted to this
      partition
      - note that these updates are higher-level updates
      - let these be the _new updates_
      - let minNewLSN be the LSN of the first new update
      - ensure that you've obtained redo updates up through minNewLSN - 1
      - apply new updates after redo updates
      - skip updates to pages older than its pageLSN (or just re-apply them if
        log records log idempotent ops, e.g. "after" images)
    - never quiesces the system
  - truncating logs
    - when any one replica fails at minLSN, others better have logs starting at
      or before minLSN
      - if replica is dead for long time, start flushing logs to disk
      - alternatively, give up on logs that grow too large, and have the
        recovering node discard and fetch all state (no logs involved)
    - also may want to flush to disk anyway to minimize memory storage
      requirements
    - normal operation: keep others informed of your minLSN regularly (e.g. as
      you flush each page)
      - each replica can then truncate up to min of all received minLSNs
  - vs. HARBOR, which maintains no logs
    - however, historical queries effectively "generate the log"
    - minLSN = HWM
    - time-travel + historical queries seem to be mainly useful for working
      with non-replicas (containing different logical partitions of objects;
      i.e. multiple _recovery objects_ and _recovery buddies_ per object)
    - also, this may be faster if many tuples is inserted then deleted during
      the downtime (not sure if HARBOR does this, but can modify query to
      ignore such tuples)
    - different assumptions
      - HARBOR has abundant storage capacity (disk), so can afford to keep
        history
      - overhead & complexity in snapshotting and maintaining segments
      - QUESTION: did HARBOR also consider using logging? what were the main
        reasons for current design?
    - QUESTION: why perform final updates? why not wait for the highest epoch
      to expire, and stream in queries from coord, then apply them after
      recovery, rather than introducing quiescing?
    - must synchronously advance timestamps (with coord)
- another version of algo
  - round-robin full-database snapshotting among the replicas
    - enables xact logging
- decision tree
  - for multi-partition xacts: seq good enough?
    - yes: h-store default
    - no: pre-order or post-order?
      - pre-order: speculation (of success vs. failure, not ordering)
      - post-order: pessimistic or optimistic concurrency control?
        - pessimistic: distributed locking
        - optimistic: distributed read sets and write sets
  - unclear which of pre-order, pessimistic, optimistic is better
- QUESTION: how to evaluate performance?
  - it's possible the recovering node may never catch up if transactions are
    being processed at maximum (resource-saturating) throughput
  - possibility: how much slower is the system's peak throughput
- TODO look at
  - [Paxos made live](http://labs.google.com/papers/paxos_made_live.html):
    snapshots in section 5.5, which may be useful to think about the interface
    between the replication system and the database
- other thoughts
  - Sam thinks this is the most concrete idea so far

Elasticity

- elasticity: seamlessly add/remove nodes into the system while minimizing
  impact on availability
- may be closely related to recovery
- how much churn?
  - Google-style incremental growth and frequent recovery
  - pay-as-you-go services encourage dynamically resizing (perhaps
    substantially) throughout the day
- other thoughts
  - elasticity slightly more exciting than recovery

H-Store distributed transaction manager: transaction consistency among replicas
XXX ADDRESS TODOS

- high-level picture
  - distributed xact mgr
    - Coordinator (perhaps a library on each client, like JDBC) interacts with
      DB Master Executor
      - Coord sends xact blobs to ME
      - ME inspects xact, identifies partitions to Coord
      - Coord dispatches queries to partitions
      - within each partition, master waits to hear from majority of nodes (incl. self)
      - Coord sends results to the ME; ME processes them
      - single-partition xacts commit immediately while in the partition
        - Coord failures don't matter; partition exclusively holds the state of
          the xact
      - multi-partition xacts require Commit Log servers
        - ME notifies Coord of commit/abort
        - Coord records results to the cluster of Commit Log servers
        - these are to deal with Coord failure (only relevant in the case of
          multi-partition xacts, since single-partition xacts commit
          immediately)
        - actual xact state is recorded here among the servers (also using
          consensus/master-slave hybrid)
    - partitions use hybrid strategy
      - use paxos consensus to decide on master lease
      - master-slave replication
    - recovery and elasticity deeply intertwined with distributed xact mgr
    - open question: wide-area replication vs. relaxed consistency in the event
      of site failures
      - how much does wide-area replication actually hurt throughput?
    - open question: symmetric vs. asymmetric sites?
    - to conserve resources/reduce cost of availability
      - ship logs to dest nodes; they only store, no computations required
      - what about chain-replication?
  - one problem with elasticity: re-balancing

- _primary/backup replication_ aka _master/slave replication_
  - operation
    - primary server receives all requests and broadcasts them to backup
      replicas
    - after master receives acks from majority of replicas, ack client
  - properties
    - master orders all requests, solving the ordering problem
    - handling master failures is harder
    - if network partitions or behaves arbitrarily, need to either use
      consensus or totally ordered broadcast
- consensus (Paxos)
  - tolerates only $\lfloor {\frac{n-1}{2}} \rfloor$ failures
  - so, on partition, only one partition can continue operation
  - strong consistency and partition tolerance, but sacrifices availability
- hybrid primary/backup with consensus
  - use paxos to decide who gets the master lease
  - advantage: within a primary/backup group, more failures can be tolerated
  - disadvantage: master must stay alive, or need to re-lease
  - used by GFS and BigTable
- totally ordered broadcast
  - deliver msgs to a group of processes in the same order
  - shown to be equiv. to consensus, if strong consistency is required
  - with weaker semantics, other solutions possible
    - there exists an algo that allows group to continue functioning even in case of partition
    - leads to _fork consistency_, where each partition works on its own copy of the data
    - merging forked copies is hard, slow
      - how to handle conflicting transactions?
- distributing transactions
  - single partition, read-only: any replica; attach last xact ID
  - single partition, read-write: all replicas
  - one-shot, no aborts: TODO cannot parse: "order components of xact relative
    to overlapping multiple partition xacts"
  - general transactions
    - if aborts are possible, use traditional concurrency control; slows down
      all xacts in that partition
    - 2PC required to agree on committed/aborted state of each xact
    - batching may reduce time spent in this mode
- centralized global coord: TODO don't grok
- _viewstamped replication_: TODO

Alternative Data Stores
-----------------------

Eddie Kohler and Robert Morris want to create a data store that is simpler (and
hopefully more usable) than a conventional DBMS.

- hot area: Dynamo, HP SOSP 2008, etc.
- "ACID unnecessary"...but what semantics do you want?
- probably a key-value store with get()/put() interface, a la BerkeleyDB
- one concrete idea: a simple log storage system
  - every so often, collect/compress/sort/optimize into a nicer data structure
  - log is the only place where recent updates are stored
  - also don't worry about durability
- other thoughts
  - very amorphous
  - not terribly excited about disk
- TODO: related work, think about a more concrete premise

Object Database

- something in the context of H-Store?
- QUESTION: what exactly are the performance issues with ORMs?
- other thoughts
  - I like hacking on my stupid personal object database system

How to make OLTP and OLAP co-exist?

- original problem: Pawan had problems running OLAP queries on web app DB
- solution: use a DBMS with weaker consistency (e.g. snapshot isolation). duh
  - HARBOR applies this principle, in a sense

Multicore Database Projects
---------------------------

Build a multicore OLAP system (i.e. relational [Phoenix])

- Phoenix ignores I/O
- you can try to attach enough disks until you saturate the CPU, but...
  - today it's all about horizontal scaling with *commodity hardware*
    - cabinets with disk arrays are dead because they're disproportionately
      more expensive, harder to replace, etc.
    - also, high-profile success stories (Google, etc.) advocate scaling out
      with commodity
  - one way to spin this project: "we reduce your entire data warehouse onto
    a single chip (well, system)!"
    - one question is whether people will buy this, or stick to their cheap
      commodity guns
    - QUESTION: exactly how much more TCO are disk array systems, really?
  - what are the stats? what's the I/O bandwidth limit? how many disks?
    - [maxhd]: "the fastest modern desktop hard drives transfer data at a
      maximum of about 120 MB/s"
    - [dbcol]: "Despite capacities and transfer rates increasing by factors
      or 10,000 and 100 respectively, typical drive ETB has actually
      decreased by a factor of 100."
    - [tilera]: "Up to 50 Gbps of I/O bandwidth"
      - 50,000Mbps / 120Mbps = 416 disks, so more than enough I/O bandwidth
      - this is a minimum; with anything less than perfectly sequential
        access, must attach even more
  - QUESTION: is OLAP ultimately bound by disk capacity or disk bandwidth?
    - i.e., do people add more (smaller) disks/systems to decrease their
      query times? or is the number of disks/systems entirely dictated by
      capacity?
  - TODO: what have people done already in multiprocessor/multicore OLAP?
    - certainly, big DBMS vendors must already have multiprocessor operators in
      their products, no? then need to have a different story
- what about using distributed main memory as storage?
  - esp. with the arrival of 10gigE, much faster than disks
    - 50 GB/s IO bandwidth, so 50GB/(10Gb/8)=40 10gigE network cards
    - TILE64 already have dual XAUI
  - but: OLAP generally deals with large data warehouses, so making memory the
    capacity bottleneck is not cost-effective (I assume warehouses are large)
- other issues
  - research nugget? many of the tricks we've been discussing tend to be highly
    hardware specific
  - saturating the I/O bandwidth still doesn't mean anything; CPUs can still
    sit idle, which means no scalability
  - who knows what the architecture of tomorrow really will be? the stats
    quoted above (e.g., bandwidth) can vary substantially from architecture to
    architecture
  - people seem less excited about OLAP in general (parallel processing is
    somehow slightly sexier, esp. if it requires high availability, a la
    Map-Reduce)
  - this should really just be a C-Store sub-project, which would make this
    a marginal project

Speculatively execute transactions in multiple orders

- premise so far
  - can't always partition transactions cleanly among tiles; this is for when
    working with shared memory
- this is aimed at improving the performance of workloads that involve multiple
  concurrent transactions where there's blocking due to pess. concurrency
  control
  - so this won't do for strictly OLTP workloads
    - queries are too short and selective
    - so no H-Store
  - context must be either mixed OLTP/OLAP or strict OLAP
  - strict OLAP: multiple large datasets probably makes things harder
- TODO: need to figure out a more concrete premise
  - it sounds from the premise above that we were thinking of H-Store, but its
    OLTP queries are short
  - so a conventional RDBMS? C-Store?
- reservations
  - where would this be usable? need to cluster data enough such that they are
    not in the same tile but in the same host...
  - speculation comes at a cost (undo or redo, pick one); doubtful whether
    gains offset costs
  - (related to above point) wasteful: people will want to do other things on
    their multicore systems
  - marginal project

Speculative prediction

- no idea here
- no idea about domains/applications either
- maybe a related question is what the analogous general programming model look
  like

Safe File-Sharing
-----------------

Start with social networks as a trust network to avoid getting caught by the
*AA. XXX FINISH

- general guiding principles
  - want to find a lot of files
  - onion routing is slow; expected(min(xs)) is a decreasing function of |xs|
  - swarming is fast; this is another reason to want to maximize the number of
    files present
- users publish pubkey to profile to restrict the scope of file searches
- is *searching* hard? indexing seems hard...
  - supernode selection in an expander graph such that every span-$r$ subgraph
    contains at least one supernode
- meet halfway by also doing partial dissemination, particularly of rare files
- plausible denialibility: clique swarms
- TODO: see also intel research's work on random walks in social networks
- TODO: related/background work search!

Distributed Programming Models
------------------------------

- harder than concurrent programming models, which itself is far from solved
- focus on expression problem and/or program synthesis?
- related work
  - process calculi
  - orchestration languages: orc
    - address issues like cancellation
  - awesome and underrated: P2
  - the pragmatic: mace, erlang, etc.
  - stream processing: Dryad, MapReduce, Borealis, maybe WaveScript
  - unknown: MPD, Acute
  - parallel PL:
    - X10
    - Chapel
    - Fortress
    - Titanium
    - Ease, Carnap
  - marginally: Mozart (aspects, mobile agents)
