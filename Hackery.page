- hadoop
  - containers (sources/sinks)
    - files
      - SequenceFile: provides len-delimiting btwn keys/values and btwn records

        - built-in compression codecs: bz2, gzip, default (?)
      - InputFormat: FileInputFormat:
        - SequenceFileInputFormat: uses SequenceFileRecordReader

        - KeyValueInputFormat: tab-separated lines
  - serialization
    - Writable: WritableComparable:
      - hadoop records aka Jute
        - used in RPC
        - primitives: byte, bool, int, long, float, double, ustring, buffer
          - buffer (BytesWritable): use this for eg protobufs
        - composites: record, vector, map
          - Record: abstract; for generated classes
          - DDL (link.jr) to `rcc -l C++` or `Java`

        - encodings: binary, CSV, XML
    - avro
    - hadoop
      - used to require keys/values to be Writables, but now uses Serializers
        and class factories
        - there's WritableSerialization
    - old
      - RecordReader: also had DBRecordReader

- disks
  - sector: 512 B
  - partition: physical region on disk; serves as a storage container
    - windows PC: first partition starts at sector 63
  - volume: OS abstraction for storage container
    - usu just a single partition
    - logical volume managers (LVMs) can create virtual volumes; eg concat or
      stripe partitions

- gdb
  - mostly implemented using ptrace

- athena
  - `system:htaccess.mit`: the web server group

- random vocab

  - ILP32: int, long, ptr are 32 bits
  - LP64: long, ptr are 64 bits

- other RDBMSs
  - main-memory hsqldb: only `read uncommitted`

- mysql
  - explain/optimization
    - select types
      - simple: no union or subqueries
      - primary: outermost select
      - subquery
      - dependent subquery: correlated subquery
      - derived: subquery in `from`
      - uncacheable subquery: must re-evaluate for each outer tuple
    - join/access types, best to worst
      - const: index lookup yielding exactly 1 row; can turn the result of this
        index lookup into constant

          SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE primary_key=1;

          SELECT * FROM tbl_name
            WHERE primary_key_part1=1 AND primary_key_part2=2;

      - eq_ref: ref where the inner table yields exactly 1 row

          SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
            WHERE ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;

          SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table

              AND ref_table.key_column_part2=1;

      - index_merge: use multiple indexes
      - unique_subquery: non-dependent (non-correlated) subquery using unique
        index; turn index lookups into constants
      - index_subquery: non-correlated subquery using non-unique index; turn
        index lookups into constants
      - range: use index to select a range; 
      - index: index scan (per outer row); only if predicate and selected
        columns are covered by index
      - all: full table scan (per outer row)
    - columns
      - key: the key used by this join/access type
      - ref: which outer columns are compared against `key`
  - innodb
    - storage format
      - if table has int primary key, use that as tuple id; otherwise add tuple
        id for each tuple
      - var-len cols
        - compact/redundant ("antelope"): up to 768B in record (for prefix
          indexes), rest in overflow page
          - at least 2 rows + some metadata must fit in each 16KB page, so
            limit for whole row is ~8KB
        - dynamic/compressed ("barracuda"): 20B ptr whenever not fit; prefix
          index can be built separately
        - each value has exclusive overflow pages; no sharing
  - monitoring/mgmt
    - `show engine innodb status`
    - `show processlist`
    - `kill 3` kills process 3 in processlist

    - http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=10327
    - no sort merge join (certainly no map-reduce contender), let alone
      hash-join
    - optimizer only recently started working properly with certain subqueries
    - auto_increment jumps up to next power of 2 but inconsistently across
      versions (platforms?); this is undocumented
    - scoping is broken

       mysql> create table t(a int, b int);
       Query OK, 0 rows affected (3.30 sec)
       mysql> select a, (select count(*) from (select b from t where a = u.a group by b) v) from t u;
       ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'u.a' in 'where clause'

    - optimizer sucks

        mysql> SELECT distinct t1.tableid FROM transactionlog t1 JOIN transactionlog t2 ON t1.tableid=t2.tableid AND t1.tupleid=t2.tupleid AND t1.partition!=t2.partition LIMIT 100;

    underlying table(s)
  - triggers: executed in-transaction
  - notify/listen: messaging to clients
    - sent only after commit

      - put in ELF section `.eh_frame_hdr`; used by gdb, `backtrace()` (even
        though docs say `-fomit-frame-pointer` breaks it)

- Hotspot

  - From <http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/whitepaper.html>

    > In the Java HotSpot VM, no handles are used by Java code. Object
    > references are implemented as direct pointers. This provides C-speed
    > access to instance variables. When an object is relocated during memory
    > reclamation, the garbage collector is responsible for finding and
    > updating all references to the object in place.

  - raw pointers not too bad to update since you must traverse all objects
    anyway

    - they probably use the mark word to redirect to the new location

  - GC: generational; parallel young

  - objects copied in DFS; this clusters related objects together

  - vocab
    - _ordinary object pointer (OOP)_

  - compressed OOPs: in Java 7; 32-bit ptrs
    - `wide_oop = narrow_oop == 0 ? 0 : (narrow_oop << 3) + base`
    - allows up to 4B objs/32GB

  - Each object has special first word for synchronization, marking, hashing

    > First word of each object is the _mark word_
    >
    > Used for synchronization and GC
    >
    > Also caches hashcode, if previously computed

  - from <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-benchmark1.html>
    - blocks need to execute 1500 (client) or 10000 (server) times before
      they're JITed
      - compile whole method
      - on-stack replacement: can replace with compiled method in middle of a
        call to it (eg if loops in main)
        - however, code quality suboptimal: can't do loop-hoisting,
          array-bounds check elimination, or loop unrolling
        - only way to defeat this: move tight loops into their own methods
    - code can be deoptimized if assumptions made during JIT no longer hold
      - eg class loading that invalidates monomorphic call transformations
      - eg uncommon traps: only the most common code path is compiled (like in
        tracing JIT?), but turns out to be uncommon
    - dead code elimination
    - memory optimizations
      - hoisting heap values into registers
      - stack allocation
      - object eplosion

- alignment

  - `posix_memalign`: useful for aligning to cache line sizes

- sockets

  - on linux, default: SO_RCVBUF = 87380, SO_SNDBUF = 16384

- non-blocking IO quirks

  - sockets that are accepted from a non-blocking listener are blocking

  - EAGAIN == EWOULDBLOCK == 11

  - From select(2):

    > Under Linux, select() may report a socket file descriptor as "ready for
    > reading", while nevertheless a subsequent read blocks.  This could for
    > example happen when data has arrived but upon exam‐ ination has wrong
    > checksum and is discarded.  There may be other circumstances in which a
    > file descriptor is spuriously reported as ready.  Thus it may be safer to
    > use O_NONBLOCK on sockets that should not block.

  - From [section 13.2 of the
    manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/I_002fO-Primitives.html#I_002fO-Primitives):

    > EAGAIN
    >
    > Normally, when no input is immediately available, read waits for some
    > input. But if the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file (see File Status
    > Flags), read returns immediately without reading any data, and reports
    > this error.

- listen actually accepts connections (based on the backlog argument)
  - accept just takes one of the already-accepted connections

- inotify: Linux's filesystem change notification facility
  - obsoletes dnotify
  - difficult for efficient (real-time) detection due to coarse granularity
    (directory level)

- tcp wrapper (TCP_WRAPPERS)
  - libwrap: just the library
  - openssh's sshd uses libwrap

- /dev/shm/: tmpfs (in-memory)

- strace more comprehensive than ltrace

- Collada DAE files: standard 3D model interchange format established by the
  Khronos group (established at SIGGRAPH 06 to maintain OpenGL)

- status of AIO

  - From <http://davmac.org/davpage/linux/async-io.html>:

    > A more subtle problem with non-blocking I/O is that it generally doesn't
    > work with regular files (this is true on linux, even when files are
    > opened with O_DIRECT; possibly not on other operating systems). That is,
    > opening a regular file in non-blocking mode has no effect for regular
    > files: a read will always actually read some of the file, even if the
    > program blocks in order to do so. In some cases this may not be
    > important, seeing as file I/O is generally fast enough so as to not cause
    > long blocking periods (so long as the file is local and not on a network,
    > or a slow medium). However, it is a general weakness of the technique.

    > ...
    >
    > The select() function is documented in the libc manual. As noted, a file

  - From <http://www.mail-archive.com/libevent-users@monkey.org/msg01226.html>:

    > I wouldn't expect AIO to knock your socks off on Linux (and certainly not
    > *BSDs). Kernel support doesn't exist for AIO operating through the disk
    > buffer cache. Linux only supports AIO for direct I/O, which is extremely

  - atomic field updaters

- reentrancy
  - aka "purity"; output depends only on inputs (and static constants); no
    static state is changed (no side effects)
  - an interrupt handler is reentrant if it reenables interrupts early on
  - implies thread safety

- thread safety
  - ways to realize:
    - reentrancy: state is private per caller (eg on stack)
    - mutual exclusion: can update static state, but serialize accesses
    - thread-local storage: each thread has private copy of statics
    - atomic operations: using special atomic machine instructions; lock-free

  - `-march=native`: new option since gcc at least 4.3.2

  - __attribute__: general metadata attached to funcs, vars, etc.
    - `__attribute__ ((constructor))`: have a function get run before `main`
  - __inline__: force inline
    - XXX: same as always_inline?
    - `static __inline __attribute__((always_inline, no_instrument_function))`

  - global offset table (GOT): in PIC, constants are accessed via this;
    resolves the GOT entries by OS's dynamic loader
  - procedure lookup table (PLT): used to resolve procedure call relocation
    placeholders; used alongside GOT in ELF
  - symbol visibility
    - default visibility: importing exe can override functions referenced by
      lib; useful for eg changing behavior of malloc
    - hidden/internal visibility: not visible to outside
    - protected visibility: visible to outside, but internal references use
      lib's def'n
      - slower at link time due to C requirement that ptrs to same function
        must be equal

    - pid's can be reused, but running and zombie pid's are unique (`kill`'s
      semantics demand it)
    - pid 0: idle task, never exits; pid 1: `init` task (calls `wait`
      periodically to sweep up zombies)

    - generally not so bad for security
    - AllowOverride Options doesn't actually enable everything
      - eg "Option SymLinksIfOwnerMatch not allowed here"

- ruby
  - must require 'rubygems' first
  - #ruby-talk better than #ruby

- boost.serialization
  - binary format is quite verbose, has a lot of boilerplate overhead
    - serializing a single int takes 43 bytes; long long takes 47
  - still can't wrap my head around the "stream error" exceptions it throws
    - tricky to use stringbuf, stringstream, etc. properly
    - issues: ios_base::binary?  can't work with stringstream(string(...))?

- boost.test

  - scheduler works on threads

- linkage
  - if a library contains an _init symbol or function marked with __attribute__((constructor)), it will be immediately when loaded. There's no way to "pause" the library loading, switch seccomp on, and then allow the library loading to continue. (<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1019707/sandboxing-in-linux>)


- type coercion: implicit type conversion

- dwarf: the debug info format used by gcc/gdb/etc

- sipb-mp3

- zephyr
  - You have to mkdir ~/zlog first; barnowl will not create the directory for you.
  - .anyone is your buddy list.
  - .zephyr.subs is your class/instance subscription list.
  - `znol` tells you who on your buddy list is online
    - if this gives you "znol: No such file or directory while getting
      WindowGram port" then try `zwgc -ttymode`
  - `zwrite` lets you send messages
  - when starting to send a message you'll get a ping from that person (this
    doesn't seem to show up in barnowl by default)

    - then merge diff btwn versions into current project trunk: `svn merge
      https://repo/vendors/foo/1.{0,1}`
  - `svn log -rHEAD:1 ...`: really show all log entries; default range is
    BASE:1, which means since last svn update
  - `svn cat -r 1 https://project.com/file.txt@HEAD`: cat the file that is
    currently named `/file.txt`, but as of revision 1 (regardless of whatever
    name it had back then).  1 is the _operative revision_, and `HEAD` is the
    `peg revision`.

      - if no CRT, must specify WinMain-like function with `/entry:`
    - CRT vs Windows API

        - `#pragma intrinsic(abs, memset)
    - `dumpbin`: useful disassembler and pecoff parser

  - have just one instance of program running at a time by trying to create a
    named Monitor either under Local\ or Global\
  - can have 0-thread procs
  - processes/threads
    - priority is inherited iff parent is < normal class (below normal/idle)
    - groups: used by `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` (kinda like posix signals)
    - default stacks on 32-, 64-bit: commit 4KB, reserve 1MB
    - stack guard pages trigger commits on reserved stack space
    - limited by virt mem on 32-bit OS, commit on 64-bit OS
    - 200 KB min working set size (code + data)
  - NUMA support: processor groups
    - threads assigned to groups; processes can straddle n groups

    - `StackWalk64`: obtains a stack trace

- windows kernel dev
  - SKU: TODO
  - data execution prevention (DEP): TODO
  - memory
    - virt mem: _reserved_ or _committed_, _private_ or _pagefile-backed_ (shared)
      - _commit charge_: system-wide total commit
      - _commit limit_: approx. phys + swap; swap can grow
      - PF-backed must be allocated by opening handle to a Section object
      - only private can be accounted to processes
    - upper 1GB or 2GB of 4GB virt addr space is kernel
  - memory manager
    - _PFN database_: array of 28-byte structs, one per page; tracks assignments to addr spaces
    - devices are mapped into phys and virt addr space; eg gfx card can take up a lot on 32-bit systems
  - crash dumps
    - mini (64K), kernel (XP produces ~60M on 256M), full
  - system service dispatches (syscalls)
    - all go through `ntdll.dll`; `Zw*` for kernel, `Nt*` for user
    - many undocumented
    - trap into `KiDispatchService`/`KiSystemService`

        ZwCreateFile:
          mov eax, SERVICEINDEX

          int 2eh # sysenter on xp
          ret 2ch

    - `KeServiceDescriptorTable[Shadow]`: global syscall tables
      - KSDT is exported by ntoskrnl.exe, but not KSDTS
    - syscall nums are OS version-dependent

        DWORD * addr = (DWORD *)
          (1+(DWORD)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle("ntdll.dll"),
                                   "NtCreateSection"));

    - kernel finds target addr in _thread environment block (TEB)_
      - TEB contains regs, pri, process ptr, service descriptor table (SDT)
        ptr, more
      - ie, there's a per-thread syscall table
      - SDT contains ntoskrnl and win32k system service tables (SSTs)
        - SST contains
          - system service dispatch table (SSDT): array of fn ptrs
          - always-0 field
          - number of entries in SSDT/SSPT
          - system service parameter table (SSPT): array of byte counts
        - for win32k syscall numbers, subtract 0x1000 to get offset
        - bits 12, 13 specify which of the four possible SDTs to look in
        - SDT ptr offset in TEB is also OS version-dependent

            struct SYS_SERVICE_TABLE {
              void **ServiceTable;
              unsigned long CounterTable;
              unsigned long ServiceLimit;
              void **ArgumentsTable;
            };

    - when changing, either disable write protection in cr0, or map the SSDT's
      phys addr into a new virt addr and access via that

  - debugging
    - virtual pc: use the virtual com port
      - run this on the target machine in an admin cmd; `bcdedit` is a program
        that edits boot settings, which in older systems was specified in a
        file `boot.ini`:

          bcdedit -debug on
          bcdedit -dbgsettings serial debugport:1 baudrate:115200

      - in the vm settings, configure the com port to map to named pipe
        `\\.\pipe\<pipe name>`

      - reboot the target

      - prepare the environment variables for windbg to be able to
        automatically fetch symbols and sources (not sure what the syntax here
        means but `\\symbols\symbols` is a microsoft-internal symbol server)

          set _NT_SOURCE_PATH=SRV*;
          set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=srv*c:\syms*\\symbols\symbols

      - connect to vm on a remote machine (same as args to kd; if local machine
        use `.` for `vpc_host_machine`):

          windbg -k com:port=\\<vpc_host_machine>\pipe\<pipe name>,pipe,resets=0,reconnect

        - `resets=0`: required for VPC; use `2` for a competing VM product
        - `reconnect`: does 2 things
          - if named pipe is not found on target, wait for it
          - if pipe disconnects, wait for reconnect

    - windbg: gui
      - used to be for user mode only while kd for kernel; now all unified into
        windbg
      - hit ctrl-break to break the target
      - commands/examples
        - `bp nt!NtReadFile`: set a breakpoint in driver `NtReadFile` of driver
          `nt`
        - `g`: continue
        - `??`: evaluate a (C++) expression
    - ntsd: cui

    - useful for `LIST_ENTRY`
  - `LIST_ENTRY`: an entry in a doubly linked list
    - use this by including it into your struct, e.g.: `LIST_ENTRY`
    - use `CONTAINING_RECORD` to get the containing struct given a list entry
  - lookaside lists: adaptive memory pool for allocating/freeing fixed size
    blocks
    - if can't alloc from/free into the pool, go through normal heap mgr
    - pool grows/shrinks adaptively

  - threads/processes
    - thread: unit of scheduling; has regs, IP, SP
    - process: >=1 thread; has handles, sec token, AS
  - threads
    - each has 2 stacks: 1 user, 1 kernel (1:1 scheduling)
    - priorities
      - 1-15: _dynamic_ priorities; kernel can boost/drop this temporarily to
        increase system tput (but never boosted to real-time)
        - boosted when it completes an IO req, waits for event/semaphore, or
          starves; also, some situations when threads in GUI or foreground
        - drivers can specify boost in `IoCompleteRequest` and `KeSetEvent`,
          `KePulseEvent`, `KeReleaseSemaphore`
      - 16-31: _real-time_ priorities; never changes
      - _base priority_: inherited from process's base priority
      - _current priority_: priority at any given time
      - kernel-mode driver running in context of user thread: base pri = pri of
        user process
    - contexts
      - permissions: eg driver routine called from user mode context can call
        `Zw*` routine in kernel context
      - for driver routines, context depends on device type, driver position in
        device stack, and other activities in system
      - eg dispatch routines run in context of requesting thread, but might
        queue IO op for processing by lower level drivers
      - some routines run in system thread context; have addr space of system
        process and security rights of OS itself
    - instead of calling `PsCreateSystemThread`, borrow a system thread from
      pool shared by all drivers
      - `IoQueueWorkItem(...IO_WORKITEM...)`
      - 3 queues: delayed, critical, hypercritical
      - run at `IRQL_PASSIVE_LEVEL`
      - using up too much time or too many workers can deadlock the system
    - refs: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810029.aspx>
  - interrupt request level (IRQL): distinct from x86 IRQLs
    - low to high: passive, apc, dispatch, cmc, device interrupt (dirql), pc
      profile, synch, clock, clock2, IPI, power, high
    - all threads run at IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL
    - thread scheduler itself ("dispatcher") runs at DISPATCH_LEVEL
    - hence any thread running at/above DISPATCH_LEVEL has exclusive use of cpu
    - DISPATCH_LEVEL interrupts are masked off on the cpu, so thread scheduler
      is disabled / cannot schedule any other thread
      - using this you can run uninterrupted but cannot incur page faults (bc doing so requires suspending thread until swapped)
      - ISRs, DPCs run here
    - for shared memory synchronization, drivers should use a lock that raises
      the IRQL to the highest level at which any code that accesses the data
      can run
      - eg use spin lock to protect data that can be accessed at
        IRQL=DISPATCH_LEVEL
    - cpu-specific IRQLs
      - DISPATCH_LEVEL
      - DIRQL
      - HIGHEST_LEVEL
    - thread-specific IRQLs
      - PASSIVE_LEVEL: normal operating state; use thread scheduling pris
        - all user code; only kernel can elevate
        - threads are both preemptible and interruptible
      - PASSIVE_LEVEL in critical region:
        - use `KeEnterCriticalRegion`/`KeLeaveCriticalRegion`
      - APC_LEVEL: most commonly associated with paging IO
    - only IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL can use paged pool

  - asynchronous procedure calls (APCs)
    - software interrupts targeted at a specific thread
    - system uses APCs to perform work in context of a particular thread, eg
      writing back the status of an IO operation to the requesting app
    - how a target thread responds to APCs depends on the thread's state and
      the type of APC

  - devices
    - have a number of entry point routines that a driver can set
    - a driver can own many devices; usu. create one device obj for each device
    - device extensions: main storage space for device state
  - objects & object manager
    - objs are ref-counted
    - a process can own 16M handles
    - kernel objects: accessible only to rest of kernel
      - eg physical devices, certain synchronization services
    - executive objects: accessible to all; apps can wrap objects too

    - objects: header (used by obj mgr) and body
    - named and unnamed
    - user-accessible named objects are under `\BaseNamedObjects`
    - by default, creating an object creates it under `Local\` which maps to
      global `Session\n\BaseNamedObjects`

    - IoMarkIrpPending holds the request (for async processing)

      > Unless an IRP's dispatch routine completes the IRP (by calling
      > IoCompleteRequest) or passes the IRP on to lower drivers, it must call

    - IO mgr creates an array of IO stack locations for each IRP
      - each driver owns one IO stack location; get with
        IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation
      - each driver responsible for calling IoGetNextIrpStackLocation to set up
        next-lower driver's IO stack location (if not passing new IRP
        altogether)
    - IoAllocateIrp creates a new IRP
      - eg used by driver to break IRP up into sub-IRPs (maybe to multiple
        other drivers)
      - alternative: reuse IRP by setting up next driver's IO stack location
      - _completion routine_
    - lowest level driver sets result status on IRP
      - on device interrupt, interrupt service routine (ISR) does min work:
        - stops device from interrupting
        - saves necessary context about operation
        - calls IoRequestDpc to queue a _deferred procedure call (DPC)_ that
          completes the requested op at a lower hw pri
      - DPC
        - calls IoStartNextPacket to start processing of next packet

      - paged vs non-paged pool, system cache size, etc.
      - regions used to be fixed at boot
    - resident available mem: phys mem for kernel stacks, nonpaged pool, certain kernel code/data
    - paged/non-paged pools
      - pools: the kernel's heap; eg nonpaged pool is *not* all non-pageable code/data
      - control pageability via compiler pragmas (text/data sections only) or via runtime functions
      - specify to heap allocator
      - the more pageable, the better
      - nonpaged
        - procs, threads, mutexes, sems, events, files, IRPs
        - limited by phys mem
        - takes from resident available mem
      - paged
        - registry, sections, handle tables
        - limited by addr space, commit size
    - memory descriptor list (MDL): maps VM to PM; opaque struct
      - PTEs for VM->PM; MDL for buffers associated with DMAs
      - for pageable mem: correspondence is temporary
      - IRPs can be associated with MDLs
        - MDL has pointer to IRP
        - IRP has pointer to first MDL in a chain of zero or more MDLs (MDLs
          linked by next pointers)
    - memory registers
      - drivers have full access to virt addr space, but not devices
      - devices need to use HAL _map registers_
    - globals, device extensions are in non-paged pool
    - `MmMapIoSpace`: map phys addrs (ie bus-relative IO addrs) to virt addrs
  - ndis
    - net buffer lists can be chained together
    - net buffer lists can net buffers chained together
      - NBL has pointer to head NB
      - NB has pointer to next NB
      - NB has MDL chain of packet buffers
  - synchronization
    - can wait on event, mutex, sem, thread, timer
    - some of these have diff meetings; eg thread means thread terminated
    - events have state (set or unset)
  - timing
    - KeDelayExecutionThread: sleep current thread
      - TerminateThread can still kill, even if alert=0
    - KeQueryPerformanceCounter: finest grained running count
      - "KeQueryPerformanceCounter is intended for time-stamping packets or for
        computing performance and capacity measurements. It is not intended for
        measuring elapsed time, for computing stalls or waits, or for
        iterations."
      - "Use this routine as infrequently as possible. Depending on the
        platform, KeQueryPerformanceCounter can disable system-wide interrupts
        for a minimal interval. Consequently, calling this routine frequently,
        such as in an iteration, defeats its purpose of returning very
        fine-grained, running time-stamp information. Calling this routine too
        frequently can degrade I/O performance for the calling driver and for
        the system as a whole."
    - KeQuerySystemTime: returns count of 100-nanosecond intervals since
      January 1, 1601; updated approx every 10 ms; computed for GMT
      - ExSystemTimeToLocalTime
    - KeQueryTickCount: returns a count of the interval timer interrupts that
      have occurred since the system was booted
    - KeQueryTimeIncrement: returns the number of 100-nanosecond units that are
      added to the system time each time the interval clock interrupts
  - sharing mem btwn user and kern
    - METHOD_BUFFERED: all in/out data copied to temp intermediate buffer;
      safest but slowest
    - METHOD_{IN,OUT}_DIRECT: in is buffered access; out has MDL; more details
    - METHOD_NEITHER: direct access to user memory
      - need to use `MmProbeAndLockPages`
  - languages
    - c++ is totally usable in kernel! but not stl

general kernel hackery
======================

user_bootstrap either loads a user program ELF in `load_elf()` or, if the embedded binary's name ends with `.img`, a kernel image in `load_img()`.

Virtualization

`Processor` has a `ps_mode` specifying whether it is a VM. If it is, then `processor_arch_run()` (which is called by `processor_run()`) enters `svm_run()`.

VMs are logically stored in `vmprocessor` structs, which in turn contain a VMCB. The initialization of these things occurs in `svm_vector()` via `processor_vector()`.

The _global interrupt flag (GIF)_ is a bit that controls whether interrupts and other events can be taken by the processor; it's set and cleared by `stgi` and `clgi`.
