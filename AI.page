- mege in notes from CS182, 6.867
- generalized/weighted least squares -> local linear regression with kernels -> density estimation
- Why do kernel smoothers divide the norm by λ before applying the weight fn? Isn't it dealt with in the summation in the estimator fn?

clustering

- difference from partitioning: clustering is on points that have coordinates
  or distances, rather than shapeless graphs
- hierarchical
  - agglomerative: bottom-up merging
  - divisive: top-down splitting
- partitional: determine all clusters at once; can be used in divisive
  - $k$-means: assign each point to cluster with closest centroid; initialize with random centroids
  - locality sensitive hashing (LSH): TODO
    - also used in nearest neighbor search
    - feature space vectors are sets
    - jaccard distance
    - min-hash
- density-based: discover arbitrary shapes
- 2-way-/co-/bi-clustering: objects are clustered but also their features; if
  data in matrix, then rows and columns clustered simultaneously
- distance measures: euclidian/2-norm, manhattan/1-norm, maximum norm aka
  infinity norm, hamming, inner product/cosine similarity
- many clustering algos require number of clusters as input;

Developing a self-driving car for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge (Seth Teller's
Angstrom talk, 5/1/08)

- 40 compute cores
- many other teams performed human-assisted map annotation
- Seth's team focused on going almost entirely from sensing
- many other teams used much fewer cores
- uses of sensing
  - using vision for finding paint
  - using active sensing for depth
- stereo algos: reconstruct 3D from cameras
  - recent stereo algos have a global component that is harder to parallelize
- optical flow: estimating motion across time
- groups
  - planning & control: how to stay on the white dotted lines; one technical
    focus
  - perception: another technical focus
  - working on the car
  - software infrastructure: codebase, OS, etc.
- power-bound
  - also CPU-bound in the sense that they could process rawer images, at higher
    rates, etc.
  - also IO-bound; had 2 GigE and a CAN, all mostly utilized
- Anant: near future will yield cameras that have encoders
  - Seth: these are not as useful for vision research
  - algos need to know gradients, for instance; what does MPEG do to gradients?
- looked at GPUs
  - programming models still painful
  - form factor limits (1U blades)
- didn't want DSPs either because they didn't know what algos they ultimately
  wanted; everything was exploratory
- Anant: suggest fifth team, on computation resources

decision tree learning algorithms TODO

- NP complete

generalization error

- cross validation, bootstrapping: methods to estimate generalization error;
  based on "resampling"
  - often used to choose among different models; e.g. different neural network
    architectures; choose one with lowest gen error
- cross validation
  - $k$-fold cross validation: divide data into $k$ subsets of roughly same
    size (folds)
  - train $k$ times, each time leaving out one of the subsets, then testing on
    one subset
  - LOOCV: when $k$ is the sample size ($k=n$ where $n$ is data size)
  - leave v out cross validation: more elaborate and expensive that leaves out
    all possible subsets
  - diff from "split-sample"/"hold-out" method commonly used for early stopping
    in neural networks
    - only 1 fixed subset (the validation set) used to estimate generalization
      error, not $k$ subsets; no "crossing"
  - cross-validation to split-sample is superior for small datasets
  - LOOCV good for continuous error functions/model-selection methods, bad for
    discontinuous ones
- jackknifing: LOOCV but for estimating bias not gen error
  - compute some statistic of interest in each subset
  - compare avg of these to avg of entire sample to estimate the latter's bias
- bootstrapping: seems to work better than CV in many cases
  - repeatedly analyze subsamples of the data rather than subsets
  - ea subsample is a random sample with replacement from full sample
